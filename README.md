# Portfolio-basic
This is a personal portfolio project built with HTML and CSS.

Pages included:

🏠 index.html: The main landing page showcasing my profile, projects, and skills.

📬 contact.html: A contact page where visitors can reach out to me.

This is a basic structure to start showcasing my work online. More features and styling will be added over time.
